        "__getattr__(self, name): This method is called when an attribute is accessed, but the attribute is not found in the usual places (i.e., not an instance attribute, class attribute, or attribute in any of the base classes). It is a fallback method for attribute access.\n",

        "\n",
        "###Purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "__getattr__: It is typically used to provide custom behavior for accessing non-existent attributes or implementing dynamic attributes. It can be useful for handling missing attributes gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "__getattribute__: It is a more general and powerful method that can be used to implement custom behavior for all attribute accesses. However, you need to be careful when using it to avoid infinite recursion.\n",

They are associated with the class attribute itself, allowing you to define custom behavior that applies to all instances that use the descriptor.

        "###Ease of Use:\n",
        "\n",
        "Properties are simpler to use, especially for basic attribute customization needs. They allow you to define custom behavior for getting, setting, and deleting attributes using simple decorator syntax.\n",
        "Descriptors are more complex and require defining a separate class for each descriptor. They are more suitable for advanced use cases where fine-grained control over attribute access is necessary."
