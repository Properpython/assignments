If the original variable has 'k' categories, one-hot encoding generates 'k' new binary features, where each feature indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a particular category. Only one of the binary features will be 1 for each data point, while the others will be 0, representing the category for that data point.\n",

One-hot encoding would create three binary features: \"Is_Red,\" \"Is_Blue,\" and \"Is_Green.\" For a data point with the color \"red,\" the \"Is_Red\" feature would be 1, and the other two features would be 0.\n",
