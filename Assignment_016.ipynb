To match a literal hyphen, you can place it as the first or last character inside the square brackets, like [-a] or [a-].\n",

The compilation step translates the regex pattern into a bytecode representation that can be efficiently executed by the regex engine. Reusing the compiled object avoids the overhead of recompiling the pattern for each match, leading to better performance, especially for complex or frequently used patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Readability: Compiling the regular expression into an object enhances the readability of your code. It allows you to assign a meaningful name to the regex pattern, making the code more self-explanatory. Instead of repeating the pattern throughout the code, you can use the named object, which simplifies maintenance and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reuse of Compiled Patterns: After compilation, the regular expression object can be reused multiple times in the same script or across different functions or modules. This reusability reduces redundancy and promotes a more modular and organized code structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Optimization Opportunities: By creating separate regular expression objects for different patterns, you can take advantage of potential optimizations specific to each pattern. The regex engine can optimize the execution strategy based on the characteristics of the compiled pattern, leading to better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Error Handling: Compiling the regular expression object allows you to catch and handle syntax errors in the pattern during the compilation stage itself. This helps you identify and resolve issues early in the development process."
