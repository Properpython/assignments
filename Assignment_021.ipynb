The key characteristic of true random numbers is that they are not reproducible, and their values cannot be predicted even if the entire history of previous random numbers is known.\n",

The generated sequence is deterministic, meaning that if you know the seed value and the algorithm, you can reproduce the exact same sequence of \"random\" numbers. However, pseudo-random numbers are designed to have properties that make them appear random for most practical purposes.\n",
