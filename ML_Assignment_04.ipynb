Dimensionality reduction methods transform the data into a lower-dimensional space, often using mathematical techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). Unlike feature selection, dimensionality reduction methods create new feature representations based on linear or non-linear combinations of the original features."
