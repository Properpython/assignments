        "The concept of a metaclass is an advanced topic in object-oriented programming and is specific to Python and some other languages that support metaprogramming. In Python, metaclasses allow you to define the behavior of class creation itself. In other words, a metaclass is a class for classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, everything is an object, including classes themselves. A class is an instance of a metaclass. When you define a new class, Python uses a metaclass to create that class. The default metaclass for user-defined classes in Python is the type metaclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary purpose of using metaclasses is to customize the behavior of class creation and to provide additional features or restrictions to the classes being created. This can be useful for enforcing coding standards, automatically adding methods or attributes to classes, and implementing design patterns like singletons.\n",
